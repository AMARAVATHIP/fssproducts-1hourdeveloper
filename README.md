# node-js-sample

A barebones Node.js app using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:heroku/node-js-sample.git # or clone your own fork
cd node-js-sample
npm install
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

If you are using jenkins file for the first time it won't work it shows error.

Because of this command ```sh rm -r *``` 

Change the ip address in jenkins file to your server ip address
